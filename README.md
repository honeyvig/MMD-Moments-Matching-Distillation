# MMD-Moments-Matching-Distillation
To implement MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy) Moment Matching Distillation on a video model, I'll walk you through the process using PyTorch and a simple version of the MMD distillation technique. Since we're not using the full Union model or Mochi model here, I'll demonstrate how to implement MMD on a smaller, toy video model. You can later extend this approach to larger models, such as Union or Mochi.

The overall steps are:

    Define the Teacher and Student Models: The teacher is typically a larger, pre-trained model, and the student model is smaller, which learns to mimic the teacher's behavior.
    Compute MMD Loss: The MMD loss measures the discrepancy between the feature distributions of the student and teacher.
    Optimization: The student model will be optimized using both the original task loss (e.g., classification) and the MMD loss.

Step-by-Step Code for MMD Moment Matching Distillation

We will:

    Define simple teacher and student models.
    Implement the MMD loss function.
    Train the student model using MMD distillation.

Here's the implementation:
1. Imports and Model Definition:

We'll use simple convolutional models as the "teacher" and "student" models.

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset
import numpy as np

# Simple convolutional model for video data (toy model)
class SimpleVideoModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleVideoModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv3d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, stride=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv3d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=1)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 6 * 6 * 6, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)  # Assuming 10 output classes (classification task)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)  # Flatten
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Teacher and Student Models
teacher_model = SimpleVideoModel()
student_model = SimpleVideoModel()

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
teacher_model.to(device)
student_model.to(device)

2. MMD Loss Function:

The MMD loss computes the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between the teacher and student feature representations.

def compute_mmd_loss(teacher_features, student_features, kernel="rbf", bandwidth=1.0):
    """
    Computes Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between teacher and student feature distributions.
    
    :param teacher_features: Features from the teacher model (batch x feature_dim)
    :param student_features: Features from the student model (batch x feature_dim)
    :param kernel: Kernel type for similarity computation ("rbf" for Gaussian Kernel)
    :param bandwidth: Bandwidth for the RBF kernel
    :return: MMD loss value
    """
    # RBF kernel function to compute similarity between feature vectors
    def rbf_kernel(x, y, bandwidth):
        dist = torch.cdist(x, y, p=2) ** 2  # Squared Euclidean distance
        return torch.exp(-dist / (2 * bandwidth ** 2))

    # Compute kernel matrices
    K_XX = rbf_kernel(teacher_features, teacher_features, bandwidth)
    K_YY = rbf_kernel(student_features, student_features, bandwidth)
    K_XY = rbf_kernel(teacher_features, student_features, bandwidth)

    # MMD loss calculation
    mmd_loss = K_XX.mean() + K_YY.mean() - 2 * K_XY.mean()
    return mmd_loss

3. Training Loop:

In the training loop, we compute both the classification loss (cross-entropy loss) and the MMD loss. The final loss is a weighted combination of these two.

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam(student_model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Example dataset
class RandomVideoDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, num_samples=100):
        self.num_samples = num_samples

    def __len__(self):
        return self.num_samples

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        video_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 16, 16, 16)  # Fake video tensor (C, D, H, W)
        label = torch.randint(0, 10, (1,))  # Fake label
        return video_input, label

train_dataset = RandomVideoDataset()
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True)

# Training loop
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    student_model.train()
    teacher_model.eval()  # Teacher model is frozen

    running_loss = 0.0
    for inputs, labels in train_loader:
        inputs, labels = inputs.to(device), labels.to(device)

        # Forward pass
        student_outputs = student_model(inputs)
        with torch.no_grad():  # No gradient for teacher model
            teacher_outputs = teacher_model(inputs)

        # Feature representations (flattened)
        student_features = student_outputs.view(student_outputs.size(0), -1)
        teacher_features = teacher_outputs.view(teacher_outputs.size(0), -1)

        # Compute MMD loss
        mmd_loss = compute_mmd_loss(teacher_features, student_features, bandwidth=1.0)

        # Classification loss (cross-entropy)
        criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
        classification_loss = criterion(student_outputs, labels)

        # Total loss: Classification loss + MMD loss
        total_loss = classification_loss + mmd_loss

        # Backpropagate
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        total_loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        running_loss += total_loss.item()

    # Print epoch results
    print(f"Epoch [{epoch + 1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {running_loss / len(train_loader):.4f}")

4. Evaluation:

You can evaluate the performance of the student model on a validation set, using metrics such as accuracy. The main goal is to see how well the student model generalizes after being trained using the MMD distillation technique.
Time Estimate:

    Model Setup: Setting up the model and defining the MMD loss function should take 1 day.
    Training the Model: Training the student model with MMD loss should take 1-2 days depending on the hardware setup and size of the dataset.
    Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuning the student model, adding regularization, or enhancing the distillation method could take 1-2 weeks depending on the results and the complexity of the task.

Final Thoughts:

This is a simplified implementation of the MMD distillation method on a toy video model. For a real-world scenario, you'd be working with larger models (e.g., Union or Mochi) and a more complex dataset. You can adapt this code to those models by using the same basic structure for the teacher and student models and applying MMD distillation with actual video data. The results of distillation would likely improve the generalization ability of the smaller student model.
